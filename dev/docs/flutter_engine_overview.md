# Flutter Engine Overview

## Introduction
The Flutter engine is the core component that powers Flutter applications. It's a C++ codebase that handles the heavy lifting of rendering graphics, managing UI, and orchestrating user interactions.

## Architecture
The Flutter engine's architecture is designed around several key modules:

- **Embedder**: This is the C++ code that interfaces with the operating system.
- **Engine**: The engine, written in C++, manages the Flutter Framework and core system. It handles:
    - **Animator**: Flutter Engine's animation module.
    - **Renderer**: Flutter Engine's renderer module responsible for transforming UI into pixels.
    - **Compositor**: The compositor merges layers and manages the render tree.

- **Framework**: The Flutter framework is the Dart code that is part of the SDK. This code is where most of the Flutter logic takes place.

These modules work together seamlessly to achieve the goal of rendering the UI smoothly.

### Flutter Framework and Engine Collaboration
The Flutter framework (written in Dart) and the Flutter engine (written in C++) work together through well-defined interfaces:

1.  **Rendering**: The Flutter framework describes the UI to the Engine. Then, the renderer transforms this description into pixels.
2.  **Event Management**: The Framework communicates user events to the Engine. Then, the Engine delivers them to the platform.
3.  **State Management**: The framework manages the application's state, which can change the way the interface looks or interacts. The state is then propagated to the Engine.

## Key Components

-   **Embedder**: This module is the platform-specific code that interfaces with the host operating system.
-   **Renderer**: The renderer module uses the Skia Graphics Library to produce pixels.
-   **Animator**: The Flutter Engine's animation module.
-   **Framework**: The Flutter framework is the Dart code where most of the Flutter logic takes place.

-   **Skia**: The Skia Graphics Library is used in the Renderer Module.
    -   Skia is a powerful 2D graphics library. It provides the foundation for rendering in Flutter.

-   **Impeller**: The graphics rendering backend. It will eventually replace Skia in the Flutter Engine.
    -   Impeller is designed to render graphics using Vulkan or Metal. It's the new rendering backend for Flutter.
      -   **Key Features:**
          -   **High Performance**: Offers better performance compared to the Skia backend.
          -   **Modern Low-Overhead APIs**: Designed for modern graphics APIs.
        - **Rendering**: Uses Metal or Vulkan for high performance and smooth rendering.
        - **Direct to GPU**: Leverages direct GPU access.

### How Impeller Works:
    Instead of relying on Skia for rendering, Impeller constructs a graphics pipeline using modern techniques:
    - **Scene Building**: Impeller generates a scene graph from the Flutter framework's UI descriptions.
    - **Pipeline**: Transforms the scene graph into low-level rendering commands.
    - **Execution**: Executes the rendering commands.
    - **Drawing**: It leverages the GPU for fast, hardware-accelerated drawing.

-   **GLFW**: Used for windowing.

-   **LibTxt**: Is a text library that supports text layout.
    - It is used for text layout and operations.

-   **FML**: Foundational library.
    - FML (Flutter's Material Library) is a set of core utilities used by the Engine and the framework.

## Rendering Process

Flutter's rendering process involves the following steps:

1.  **UI Description**: The engine receives a description of the UI elements to render.
2.  **Render Tree**: A hierarchical structure that manages layout and visibility.
3.  **Pixel Transformation**: Converts UI elements into renderable pixels.
4.  **GPU Integration**: Leverages hardware acceleration for graphics rendering.
    - Flutter uses hardware acceleration for its rendering. To achieve this, it integrates with the GPU, offering better performance than most other GUI frameworks.

## Role of the Engine

- The Engine is a C++ codebase, it's a C++ code that interfaces with the operating system. It's responsible for providing the entrypoint and managing the entire process.

- **Framework**: It's the Dart code that is part of the SDK.

The Flutter engine uses the framework to provide the entrypoint to the Flutter framework and the entire application's architecture.

3.  **State Management**: The framework manages the application's state, which can change the way the interface looks or interacts. The state is then propagated to the Engine.

## User Interaction
The Flutter Engine handles user interactions, from taps and drags to more complex gestures. Flutter also handles more complex gestures, such as swiping and dragging.
    - Flutter handles user interactions, from simple events such as taps, to complex gestures, such as swiping and dragging.

## State Management
The Flutter framework manages the application state.

- The framework provides information about which part of the application is changing.
- The engine is then responsible for making the corresponding changes in the UI.

## Conclusion
Understanding the Flutter engine is key to comprehending how the engine renders and works.
